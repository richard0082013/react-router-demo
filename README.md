#### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
#### We'll be using Semantic UI React which is a great styling framework with really good documentation. This     will help us make use of      a number of pre-built components to speed up our development process.
#### We'll get started with React Router 4.
#### Using Semantic UI form to create a simple multi-step forms.
#### Using Jest to do a simple Snapshot test on MainForm, to test when page loaded, the MainForm component        will be rendered.

      install react-test-renderer, a library that enables you to render React components as JavaScript objects without the need of a DOM.
    After changing the test file, rerun the test, should have a flag -u or --updateSnapshot with jest command.
#### Create a page to display users for implement lazy loading and infinite scorll. Using axios to call github api to fetch users, using Semantic UI list and loader for the UI.
